# Logos scrapped from transfermarkt.com

## Overview

I was looking for a way to do pretty visualisations with all data at my disposal. Was using logos before but sizes werent the same 
and logos were pretty anywhere in my computer, I first tried to scrap over google but with the little errors + the different sizes +
the captchas the challenge was too difficult. It at this moment I think about the greatest football database at the moment : transfermarkt.

## Objectives

* Retrieve the logos for the 305 clubs located in the "Team_raw_stats.xlsx" file

* Handling problems that raised exceptions

## What's Needed?

* Python Obviously

* Pandas

* Selenium & Requests

* Random & Time

* os

## Conclusions

The script worked pretty even though some logos needed human supervision to be correct, some as Atlas FC or Argentinian Racing Club but it has a
90% accuracy AND allowed me to do something else than downloading one by one every logos so Im pretty happy with the result. Feel free to upgrade the 
script or download all the logos directly!
